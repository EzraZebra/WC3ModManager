![WC3 Mod Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EzraZebra/WC3ModManager/master/img/logo.png)

The easiest and most reliable way to mod Warcraft III is using the "Allow Local Files" registry setting, which allows custom files in the game's install folder to be loaded by the game.

This project aims to make it as easy as possible to manage and play these mods.

The latest binary can be downloaded on [The Hive Workshop](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/wc3-mod-manager.308948/).

## Core Features
* Mount/Unmount mod - create/delete symbolic links to the mod's files in the WC3 folder
* Toggle "Allow Local Files" - enable/disable loading of custom files in the WC3 folder
* Toggle "Expansion" - switch between classic and expansion

You should be able to use other IDEs and compilers, but I haven't tested. If you succeed in doing so, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with instructions so I can include them here.
