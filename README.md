# WC3 Mod Manager
Especially with the latest patches, the most reliable way to make a mod in Warcraft III is using the "Allow Local Files" registry setting, which, as the name implies, allows files in the game's install folder to be read by the game.

## Core Features
(*)Toggle "Allow Local Files" - enable/disable the mod
(*)Toggle "Preferred Game Version" - switch between vanilla and expansion
(*)Mount/Unmount mod - automatically move the mod files to and from the game folder
