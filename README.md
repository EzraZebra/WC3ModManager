# WC3 Mod Manager
Especially with the latest patches, the most reliable way to make a mod in Warcraft III is using the "Allow Local Files" registry setting, which, as the name implies, allows files in the game's install folder to be read by the game.
This project aims to make it as easy as possible to switch between mods

## Core Features
* Toggle "Allow Local Files" - enable/disable the mod
* Toggle "Preferred Game Version" - switch between vanilla and expansion
* Mount/Unmount mod - automatically move the mod files to and from the game folder

WC3 Mod Manager is currently being developed in [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). I'm not sure if other IDEs can open and build the project.
I'm new to GitHub, so I'm not familiar with the usual procedures. Please feel free to fork, make pull requests, etc.
