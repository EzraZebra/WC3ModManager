![WC3 Mod Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EzraZebra/WC3ModManager/master/img/logo.png)

The easiest and most reliable way to mod Warcraft III is using the `Allow Local Files` registry setting, which allows custom files in the game's install folder to be loaded by the game.

This project aims to make it as easy as possible to manage and play these mods.

The latest binary can be downloaded on [The Hive Workshop](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/wc3-mod-manager.308948/).

## Core Features
* `Mount`/`Unmount` mod - _create/delete symbolic links in the WC3 folder to the mod's files_
* Toggle `Allow Local Files` - _enable/disable loading of custom files in the WC3 folder_
* Toggle `Expansion` - _switch between classic and expansion_
### Other Features
* `Create Shortcuts` - _create shortcuts that automatically launch a specific mod_

# Contributing
WC3 Mod Manager is currently being developed in [Qt Creator 4.7.2](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) and built with Qt 5.12.0/MinGW 7.3.0 64bit.

You should be able to use other IDEs and compilers, but I haven't tested.

Please feel free to fork, make pull requests, etc.
